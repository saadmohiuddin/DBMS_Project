('CCCH9005','/notes/CCCH9005','Chinese Cultural Revolution','The Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) was a defining episode in modern China. In ten years, it dismantled the state, party, and economy with widespread social upheaval and violence, followed by unrelenting oppressive campaigns. It dramatically exploded the inherent contradictions of the Communist State. It has exerted a major impact on the direction of Chinese politics, economic reforms, and public protests. This course explores the causes, processes, and impact of the Cultural Revolution (CR), asking why millions of people participated in the CR, who were the agents responsible for the CR, what determined the CR’s multifaceted courses, and what legacy the CR left for the following reform era and the coming future. It introduces students to key intellectual ideas and methodologies from multi-disciplines – history, political and social science, literature, and film. Students will learn to critically assess sources and statements, through which to discover how history is continuously constructed and contested.','Tutorial 5 will be held on Mar. 18 (Thursday groups), Mar. 19 (Friday groups), Mar. 20 (Saturday group), Mar. 22 (Monday groups), Mar. 23 (Tuesday groups) and Mar. 24 (Wednesday groups).
